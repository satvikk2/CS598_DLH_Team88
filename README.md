This is the repository for CS 598: Deep Learning for Healthcare class. The reproduced paper is TransformEHR: transformer-based encoder-decoder generative model to enhance prediction of disease outcomes using electronic health records. 
The link to the paper is here: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38030638/].

## Notebooks

The Project submission can be found in the [DL4H_Team_88_Final.ipynb]() notebook.

## How to run

The code can be run locally, or in Google Colab. Complete instructions are contained inside of the notebook.

### Project Quickstart

Note - Pass sample_size [%] as argument to the python script

Let's say, we want to run the model on 20% of data. Argument will be 0.2

Command - python3 train_ehr.py 0.2

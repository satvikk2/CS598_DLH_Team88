## Notebooks

The Project Draft submission can be found in the [DL4H_Team_88_Draft.ipynb]() notebook.

## How to run

The code can be run locally, or in Google Colab. Complete instructions are contained inside of the notebook.

### Project Draft Quickstart

The fastest way to run a demo version of the code is in Google Colab.

1. Open the [DL4H_Team_88_Draft.ipynb]() notebook.
2. Click on "Open in Colab" in the top left.
3. Upload all the .pkl files from /data/PKL to google colab. keep it in parallel with the python script. 
4. Set the runtime type to "CPU". 
5. In the Runtime menu, click on "Run all".
